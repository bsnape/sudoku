sudoku
=============

This is a basic Ruby Sudoku solver.

Currently it will solve logically simple Sudoku puzzles.

motivation
=============

I was initially inspired by [Project Euler problem 96](http://projecteuler.net/problem=96).

Although I have no interest in solving Sudoku puzzles as a hobby, I liked the idea of applying a TDD approach to a
non-trivial, yet achievable, logical problem.

setup
=============
Clone the repository

    $ git clone git@github.com:bsnape/sudoku.git

Do a `bundle install`

    $ bundle install

Run the tests

    $ rspec
